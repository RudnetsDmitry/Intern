Here are the current "issues" with this release of QtGantt.


CRASH AND BURN
--------------
* If you give no project description, qtgantt crashes ;-( (may have been fixed)

MISCELLANEOUS
-------------
* Task editor dialog doesn't update the model
* Need a user configuration file
* Need to be able to configure a date format (files will always be saved in
  dd-mm-yyyy format)
* Need the Options... dialog linking to the main menu
* Need to merge calendar/Makefile changes with Mark Jackson's source
* Need to patch calendar widget to understand different date formats
* Need to make task editor pane format dates in the required date format
* There are dependency arrow drawing bugs in GanttChart (see currentbug.gantt)
* Load a file, hit 'New' - Gantt View doesn't clear down its List View, or
  redisplay the GanttChart with nothing in it.
* Restructure Gantt so I can reuse drawing code in GanttChart, better still,
  create Milestone, Subtask and Maintask classes that take a row height and a 
  Task, (could be composite objects in the Task object), and provide QRects 
  of the correct dimensions.
* Write/Find Observer/Observable mechanism
* Add "current task pointer" to Project
* Allow this to be updated when moving through Project tasks in QListView
* Redraw GanttChart when scrolling out of view on QListView (GanttChart follows
  its table)
* When a task is updated in Task Editor, update that view's QListView.
* Add a "start of view date" to Project (we have start of project, but not start
  of view)
* Save the project start of view date in the project file
* Add horizontal/vertical scroll bar to GanttChart/Gantt
* Make this horizontal scroll bar update the project start of view


COSMETICS
---------
* In TaskEditor and GanttView, move the splitter so it's up against the
  QListView, however wide that happens to be.

* Add labels to the various fields in Task Editor

* Develop a TimeStrip widget for the top of the GanttChart
