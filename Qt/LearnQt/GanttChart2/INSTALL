INSTALLING QTGANTT


The simple way
--------------
The "Makefile" is one i grabbed from the Qt tutorial.
(Nr 7 to be exact.) If your system is configured like mine
is (Standard Redhat 6.1 with Qt in /usr/local/qt) it will
probably work. All you have to do is to type

make

and then install the executable "qtgantt" wherever you want.


The not quite so simple way (but still rather simple)
---------------------------
If the makefile doesn't fit your system, you will have to:
a) write a makefile yourself (the build and compile rules are
   at the end of the supplied "Makefile") or:
b) do it the same way I did: Grab a makefile from the Qt tutorial.

How to do this:
Copy the "Makefile" in the tutorial/t7 directory in your Qt
directory (normally /usr/local/qt) to the directory where you
unpacked qtgantt.
If you don't know where Qt is installed, run:

echo $QTDIR

When you have copied the file, open it in your favourite text
editor. Locate the "### Target" section (around line 100) and change
the line
TARGET = t7   to   TARGET = qtgantt

Now run a search/replace. Replace all occurences of
lcdrange   with   gantt
then save and exit.
Finally, you are ready do it the simple way: run

make

and then install the executable "qtgantt" wherever you want.



WHY CAN'T ANYONE WRITE A SIMPLE AUTOSCAN/AUTOCONF/AUTOMAKE TUTORIAL?
(sorry about that.. just had to let it out)
