What is it?
-----------
QtGantt is a simple application that draws and prints a Gantt schematic.
If you don't know what Gantt schematics are, you probably don't need this
app.


How does it work?
-----------------
You can give the program a *.gantt file as a command line argument, or open a
file with the "open" option on the menu. 

The scrollbar below the menu resizes the task description area (this will be
replaced by a splitter control later). 

The spinbox changes the space in pixels between each day (same as the Zoom
In/Out functions on the menu).

The "print" button (CTRL-p) opens the print dialog, which lets you print to a
printer or to a PostScript file. You can also use the -p filename option to
print directly to a file from the command line, but this gives you no control
over printing options. 

The "quit" button (CTRL-q) quits the program. 

The schematic has solid lines for each month, and dotted ones for each
week. The current date is shown with a solid red line. 

If the display is corrupted or the input file has changed while running the
program, press F5 to reload, or choose Refresh from the menu. (At the moment,
you have to edit the input file in an editor such as vi, emacs, etc. then
refresh the display. The application will become a "proper" editor as we
progress.)

If you turn on 'Week Detail', you'll see weekends shaded, today is all pink, and
you'll see the day numbers of each Monday (if you're zoomed in enough for them
to fit.)


How do I write a *.gantt file?
------------------------------
There are a number of sample .gantt files to illustrate this.

All lines starting with # are ignored by the program.

Blank lines must be empty, e.g. with no spaces or tabs.

Header lines (only one in each file) start with % and contains
the project start date and the project title, divided by a %.

All dates should be on the form dd-mm-yyyy.

Task lines (one for each task) are on the form:

number:type:startdate:expenddate:enddate:after:%completed:Task description

for example, like this:
1:main:05-01-2000:05-01-2000:27-03-2000:0:0: 1. Bananorama

"number" is the task number. 

"type" is the task type, choose:
  "task" (normal task)
  "main" (main task) or 
  "mile" (milestone).

"startdate" and "enddate" should be obvious. (If the task is a
milestone, the enddate is not read and should be left blank.)

"expenddate" is the expected end date for this task, for example, you set the
start and expected end date at the start of the project, then advance the end
date as tasks slip.

"after" tells qtgantt that this task can not be started until the task
whose number is described in "after" is finished, and makes it draw an
arrow from the end of this task to the start of the current task. If
your task does not depend on other tasks, write 0 here.

The "%completed" indicates how much of the task you have completed, and is a
percentage. The chart indicates completed percentages in a darker colour.

"Task description" contains a (more or less) detailed description of
the task.


This sucks! I could do better with my hands tied on my back!
------------------------------------------------------------
Then please do! And send me the result! (Sorry about the messy code)
Or, join our mailing list, and ask what you can do to help. Suggestions are
always welcome, and if you're not a programmer, your input will be valuable.
We will need people skilled in writing documentation, tutorials, and
translations (although not until the program is "finished").


I'd like it to do Feature X that I've seen in XYZ Planner Tool...
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Then please write to the list, and let's discuss the feature. I (Matt) have
experience of only one project planning tool, "Plan", from Twiddlebit Software
(www.twiddlebit.com), and I'd like to make QtGantt do everything that Plan does
- your goals will probably be different. Together, we can make this into a very
useful projetc planning tool. And what's more, it'll be Free Software.


Happy planning....
