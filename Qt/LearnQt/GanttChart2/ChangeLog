0.0.8
* This version of QtGantt requires Qt 2.2 - dialogs created using Qt Designer
  will not compile using Qt 2.1
* Slight misunderstanding on my part about the meaning of expenddate. Now fixed
  in README. Slight redraw bug / inefficiency fixed. Expected End Date is now
  shown in the Gantt View. 
* Tasks are now shifted up a little in the Print Preview.
* Tried adding a QScrollView to the Gantt View. Failed miserably when the view
  was split with a QScroller, so ditched the QScroller, and used a QHBoxLayout.
  Everything is relatively OK now, apart from resizing the QListView.
* Gantt View and Task Editor now show the task ID, not the task array index.
* Changed the GanttChart so that it's a bit more efficient - not recalculating
  distances between dates on every line.
* Fixed a few bugs in GanttChart's rendering, probably introduced a few more.
* Currently working on getting dependency arrow drawing right in GanttChart. See
  the afters*gantt files. currentbug.gantt shows what I'm working on fixing...
* Drew the task and project information dialogs using Qt Designer (from Qt 2.2),
  integrated these - they're available from the File menu (for the project
  properties (name and start date), and from various menus and toolbars (for
  different perspectives on task information).
* Started using Mark Jackson's calendar widget, version 0.15, which may be 
  found in its entirity in the calendar directory.
* Added several more toolbar icons, although they don't do much. Click the
  "link" icon to see the task information dialog.
* Added the long-awaited Save option.

0.0.7
* Added Gunnstein's qtgantt.pro, for tmake.
* Reorganisation of some code to fix layout problems. We now have problems with
  QT 2.2, displaying the scroll bar and spin control. Not sure why. Could the QT
  experts help?
* main and mainwidget split, now ugins a QTabWidget to display the different
  views.
* Switched to QT 2.1 for development. I have the following packages installed on
  my main development system (Red Hat 6.2/Intel):
  qt-2.1.0-4.beta1
  qt1x-1.45-3
  qt1x-devel-1.45-3
  qt-devel-2.1.0-4.beta1
  I also have QT 2.2 installed (for RH6.2/intel, and Solaris), but am not 
  currently using this due to the above layout problems.
* Added Conny Andersson's patch which adds a new field to the input files. This
  is for the "expended date". One would set start and end dates for the tasks,
  and as work progresses past the end of an end date, the expended date would be
  moved to illustrate slippage.
* Added the conv-6-7 script to convert 0.0.6 format files to the 0.0.7 format
  required by Conny's patch.
* Merged Olivier Berrod's task editor
* The "old" Gantt view is now for print preview. The new one is the
  QListView/Splitter/GanttChart one.

0.0.6
* Made more "Office-like", by using a QMainWindow. We how have a tool bar, which
  is rather unruly, since it won't bind to the left-hand edge of the window. We
  also have a tab bar, allowing the view to be changed between the "old" Gantt
  view, the "new, unfinished" Gantt View, and the "new, unfinished" Calendar 
  View. We would also have a status bar, but I can't get that to display well
  with the tab bar. The View menu also allows switching between the three views.

0.0.5
* Architecture has now split into Model / View / Controller paradigm:
  + project.cpp/h and task.cpp/h holds the Model class
  + gantt.cpp/h holds the Gantt table/Chart View class
  + main.cpp/h is the Controller class
* Wishlist items from MS Project

0.0.4
* Based on Gunnstein's 0.0.3.
* Added Week Detail toggle: this enables/disables lines for each day;
  filled-in weekends; the day-in-month number of Mondays; today is pink.
  Some of the extra graphical frills are not yet finished; I may have broken
  the dependency-drawing code.
* Pixels-per-day is now defaulted to 10, and can increase to 40.
* The 'during' field in the input file has changed to a 'completed' 
  percentage, and tasks are shown with their completed percentage 
  in dark blue, and their uncompleted percentage in light blue.
* Hard-coded pixel-measurements are now made into constants (there'll be less of
  this if/when we switch to using a layout manager)
* Added a menu, removed the buttons from the top of the window, although the
  pixels-per-day and task title width scrollbar remain. The task title scrollbar
  may probably be replaced with a QSplitter.
* The screen view now correctly shows only as much as it can hold, without
  overlaying the next screenful of tasks on top of the first page. You can
  resize to see more. Obviously this is sub-optimal, since you need a huge
  monitor to see everything on huge projects! There'll eventually be a 
  vertical scroll bar so you can scroll. Projects print perfectly.
* Command line options introduced:
  -p filename 
    This option enables you to generate postscript output of a given .gantt
    file. e.g. qtgantt myproject.gantt -p myproject.ps
