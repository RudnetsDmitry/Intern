Here is the current Wish List for QtGantt, with notes of who is doing what.

* Add the vertical scroll bar (MJG)

* Get printing working (MJG)

* Multiple dependencies: arbitrary number of arrows between one task start/end
and another task start/end to indicate the dependencies.

* Make the table act more or less like the tables in ms excel, with editing 
  capabilities (so you don't *have to* edit a text file)

* Add right-click menu to the gantt diagram, right-click a task to edit it
  (I think this would be easier if you make each task a QObject, since QObjects 
   have lots of mouse routines and stuff..)

* Lots of ideas from MS Project:
+ Promotion / Demotion of tasks
+ Summary tasks automatically summarize the duration and completedness of their
  subtasks
+ Resources: each task can be assigned to zero or more resources
+ Calendar View: each resource (?) works from one calendar. There are a few
  default calendars (working week, night shift, 24 hour), and you can define
  your own.
+ Tasks can have durations without explicit start/end dates, if they're linked
  to other tasks
+ Relationships between tasks (ASAP, FNEL, etc.)
+ Finish-Start / Start-Finish / Start-Start / Finish-Finish
+ The LHS of the Gantt view shows task indicators, names and durations. The
  splitter control is used to move the Gantt chart out of the way, exposing
  start/end date, lag, etc.

Ideas from Conny Andersson:
+ Scrollbars (to be solved by QListView mode)
+ Printing (in any zoom level)
  * The entire chart
  * The chart shown on screen
+ Connected task-mile-task-mile-task chains. This could be useful when moving
  the starting date for example.  If you enter working days instead of absolute
  dates, this would solve the problem. It could be useful to have a line,
  like the header, that tells what days are holidays and special days when no
  work should be scheduled.
